/// W05 - Mindfulness Program
/// Principles: Inheritance (base Activity + 3 derived), Encapsulation (private fields + public/protected methods), Abstraction.
/// Menu-driven console app with shared start/end messages and animated pauses.
/// 
/// Exceeding requirements (creativity):
/// 1) ReflectionActivity: avoids repeating questions in a session.
/// 2) BreathingActivity: shows a simple progress bar during countdown.
/// 3) ListingActivity: displays total items entered at the end.
